### Utilities

This repository represents a set of code snippets I have built and used across multiple projects in the past
as well as some of the (to me) interesting blueprints for the future utility functions. 

Project includes both the utilities for the React apps and the pure javascript utilities. It is written in TS to
provide more meaningful documentation.

### Setup
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run test` to run tests.
