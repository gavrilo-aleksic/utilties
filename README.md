### Utilities

This repository represents a set of code snippets I have built and used across multiple projects in the past
as well as some of the (to me) interesting blueprints for the future utility functions. 

Project is separated into several modules:
1. Useful React custom hooks
2. Typescript helper generic types for useful type-guards
3. Mathematics helper functions with logic operators, arithmetics and calculus (These are more intriguing than actually useful :D)
4. Useful methods over arrays
5. Useful Typescript decorators for method wrappings

### Setup
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run test` to run tests.
